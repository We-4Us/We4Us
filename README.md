Hello Sir. Here is our project. We Created a Social media application with so many features. Mainly we focused on the design of this project and also used the database to store the data of users. 
We did it in localhost. So, please to run this project, just follow this step-> open xampp -> Apache -> config -> Apachee(httpd.conf) -> Search Addhandler by pressing ctrl+f -> Update .py extension.

Then you have to run MySql and Apache and then you have to create a database named "we4us" the name we used as a database name. Then you just have to create a table named "reginfo" with 6 fields to store the data and create the column by the following name respectively firstName, lastName, userName, email, passs, repass.

Then just keep the folder in the C:\xampp\htdocs directory.

After the connection of the database and to run this project just go to any brower and type localhost/foldername/index1.html
